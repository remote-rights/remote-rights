**You can learn valuable information in all sorts of places:**

- podcasts
- community events and more!

It's important to learn more so you can figure out how you want to get involved!


### Check Your Sources

Be wary of false news sites. Always check the ‘About Us’ area on a website to learn about the organization. Look for unusual domain names, and read multiple news sources to see how others are reporting on the same story.

### Get Stronger and Smarter

Look for opportunities to become a better leader, like webinars and youth leadership conferences in your province/territory. There is a lot of online literature to teach you how to lead for your cause. There are also lots of programs that let you travel while you learn. Gaining skills can be an adventure!
