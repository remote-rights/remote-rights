# Create a Concrete Goal

The best campaign has a specific goal. Create a long-term goal, and then work backwards, creating short terms goals along the way.

## 1. What is Your Dream Goal?

Think of the big problem that is affecting you and your community and what your activism will change.

## 2. What Are the Steps to Getting There?

 What are some steps to achieve your ultimate dream goal? Who do you need help from? What ways do you need support? Are there materials that you need? What's the best way to get my message out here? This kind of exercise is often best to do with a group or at least one other person.

## 3. Choose a Simple Goal to Achieve First

The best goals are _SMART_ goals:

**S** = Specific (concrete, detailed, well defined)

**M** = Measurable (how are you going to measure your success?)

**A** = Achievable (is it actually possible to achieve this goal?)

**R** = Realistic (kind of similar to the one above)

**T** = Time-bound (defined timeline)


Once youâ€™ve figured out the first step to achieving your larger dream, that can become your first concrete goal! Then you can move to the next one, and then the next. You might end up re-doing your goals as you continue to advocate - that's okay! Working on a goal always leads to more learning and re-strategizing.


<!-- ???? Side bubble: Remember that goals can build on each other like blocks. Keep it simple to keep you motivated! -->
