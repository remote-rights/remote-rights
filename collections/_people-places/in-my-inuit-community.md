There are 4 Inuit regions in Canada: Nunatsiavut (Northern Labrador), Nunavut, Nunavik (Northern Quebec), and Inuvialuit Settlement Region (Northwest Territories). Together, the 4 regions are called Nunangat. Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami is a national organization that advocates for all Canadian Inuit in national politics.
