Provincial and territorial governments take care of the day-to-day running of the province/territory. They make laws through a central governing body, sometimes called a Legislative Assembly. Members of the Legislative Assembly represent the people living in a geographical area of the province or territory – that area is called an electoral district or riding. You can look up who represents your riding by going to your province/territory's website.
