Most schools are part of a system of school boards â€“ sometimes, to have impact beyond your individual school, you might want to reach out to the members (called trustees) of your school board. For a complete list of the school boards in each province and territory check out our [Resources Page](/resources).

Provincial and territorial governments are in charge of non-Indigenous schools, but most day-to-day decisions are made by the school boards (decisions like implementing the curriculum, making hiring and firing decisions, and planning when and how money should be spent on schools).
