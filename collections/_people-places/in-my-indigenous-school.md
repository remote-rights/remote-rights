Most schools are part of a system of school boards â€“ sometimes, to have impact beyond your individual school, you might want to reach out to the members (called trustees) of your school board. For a complete list of the school boards in each province and territory check out our Further Resources.

Decisions about education funding for Indigenous schools are made by the Government of Canada. For all other decisions about schools, like hiring teachers and what should be in the curriculum, a growing number of schools are managed by Indigenous communities and nations themselves.
