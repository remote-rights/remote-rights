title: What does advocacy mean?
subtitle: Advocacy is when we speak up for our rights.
---

Advocates work to:
* Make sure that everyone's rights are respected and protected.
* Make sure that everyone can live their lives with freedom and dignity.
* Change unfair laws, rules, and policies.
* Make sure that our land stays safe and clean.
* Make sure that everyone is free to speak up and be heard.


## Anyone can be an advocate for themselves or for someone else.

You just need to make sure you have the right information before you get started. Thatâ€™s where this toolkit, and other ways of educating yourself, come in!

## Some people's jobs include advocating for someone else.

You probably know lots of people in your community who are advocates for your rights like: youth workers, community centre staff, teachers, principals, doctors and nurses, chiefs, and lawyers.
