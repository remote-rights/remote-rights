Most schools are part of a system of school boards â€“ sometimes, to have impact beyond your individual school, you might want to reach out to the members (called trustees) of your school board. For a complete list of the school boards in each province and territory check out our [Resources](/resources).

Decisions about education funding for Indigenous schools are made by the Government of Canada. For all other decisions about schools, like hiring teachers and what should be in the curriculum, a growing number of schools are managed by Indigenous communities and nations themselves.
