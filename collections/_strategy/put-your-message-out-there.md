## Create some of your own media to demand change

Depending on what materials you create, you can include a lot of information or a little:

**_A little bit of information can go on..._**

- A pin to go on a backpack or coat
- A postcard - postcard campaigns are a cool way to get a lot of people to send a message to one person in particular
- A tweet

**_A medium amount of information can go in..._**

- A petition
- An info-sheet - are there specific facts that people need to know? You can create a letter-sized sheet of information to share online or hand out at events!
- A social media post
- An online or newspaper article
- A news interview

**_A lot of information can go on..._**

- A website or facebook page
- A newsletter
- An advocacy day
- An information session (in-person or virtual)

No matter what you end up making, make sure your materials can answer these questions:
What are you asking for? Why are you asking for it? How will it benefit everyone?
