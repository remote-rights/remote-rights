# Educate Yourself

<!-- Side bubble: If you don't know where to start, ask a librarian at your library! -->

## Learn About Your Issue

**Ask yourself:**
- How long has this been a problem?
- Who are the main people involved?
- Who is this affecting and who has tried to fix it?
- Who do you think still needs to get on board?

**You can learn valuable information in all sorts of places:**
- trustworthy news sites
- websites of community organizations
- Youtube channels
- blogs
- government department websites
- podcasts
- community events and more!

It's important to learn more so you can figure out how you want to get involved!


## Check Your Sources

Be wary of false news sites. Always check the ‘About Us’ area on a website to learn about the organization. Look for unusual domain names, and read multiple news sources to see how others are reporting on the same story.


## Get Stronger and Smarter

Look for opportunities to become a better leader! There are always webinars and youth leadership conferences in your province/territory. There is lots of online literature to teach you how to lead for your cause! Check out our Resources page to learn more.
